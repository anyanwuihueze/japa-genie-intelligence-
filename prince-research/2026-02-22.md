## Config Investigation & Restoration
Conducted thorough investigation of OpenClaw config schema to safely restore custom settings after `wizard doctor` reverted them to defaults.

### Issue Found
Config `wizard.doctor` run (2026-02-22T13:00:25) wiped custom settings:
- ❌ Root-level `firecrawl.apiKey` (invalid location - not in schema)
- ❌ `messages.groupChat.*` settings (not in schema)
- ❌ `commands.restart` not set (defaults to false)

### Schema-Correct Configuration
**Firecrawl API key** must go under `tools.web.fetch.firecrawl.apiKey` (not root `firecrawl`)
**Commands.restart** can be set to `true` safely
**Group chat behavior** must use `channels.telegram.groups` - custom keys under `messages.groupChat` are not valid

### Created Patch File
`/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/config_patch.json` with:
```json
{
  "commands": { "restart": true },
  "tools": {"web": {"fetch": {"firecrawl": {"enabled": true, "apiKey": "PENDING"}}}}
}
```

### Key Learning
Wizard doctor reverts unrecognized keys. Always validate custom config against schema with `gateway config.schema` first.

## Agent Coordination (Angel + Achilles)
Discussed coordination strategy for Angel (partner's agent on separate OpenClaw instance):
- Preferred: Shared memory files in `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` for async collaboration
- Backup: Telegram group mentions for synchronous coordination
- Documented: `memory/japa-genie/` folder structure for shared data:
  - `leads-incoming.md`
  - `visa-updates.md`
  - `tasks-pending.md`

## Partners
- **Prince**: My human, founder of Japa Genie
- **Sesan (Sesa)**: Prince's founding partner
- **Angel**: Sesan's agent being set up on separate OpenClaw instance

## Pending Actions
- [ ] Prince to provide Firecrawl API key
- [ ] Apply config patch with `gateway config.patch`
- [ ] Restart gateway to activate
- [ ] Brief Angel when she comes online about new config structure

## FireCrawl Activated - Web Search LIVE (2026-02-22)

### API Key Added
- fc-dc42bcd4fdac4f4cba28e33147b57b04 successfully configured
- Location: Validated via gateway restart (schema-correct)
- Status: Gateway running, FireCrawl operational

### First Search Results
Tested with "African visa agents travel agencies" - **SUCCESS**
- Found: Ambassador Passport & Visa (20+ years experience)
- Found: African Travel Inc., Palace Travel
- Confirmed: API returning structured JSON with URLs, titles, descriptions

### Target Audience Research Completed
Identified key user personas for Japa Genie:

**Persona A: Nigerian Reddit Migrants**
- Subreddit: r/Nigeria - active UK/Canada immigration threads
- Pain: Overwhelmed by visa complexity
- Opportunity: Helpful content posting

**Persona B: African Tech Remote Workers**
- Reddit: r/cscareerquestionsEU - "Seeking Advice from Ethiopia"
- Source: Breedj.com - Africa remote workforce bridging labor gaps
- Pain: Digital nomad visa confusion
- Opportunity: Clear pathway guidance

**Persona C: Portugal D8 Applicants**

### Governance Rules Established
To prevent future failures (scope creep, config breaks, overpromising):

**NO Scope Creep Rule** - You set exact deliverable, time limit, quality bar
**Defined Checkpoints** - Before each task: exact parameters
**Stop Phrases** - "I can also", "It would be better", "Let me research" = SCOPE CREEP
**Prove-It Protocol** - Write 1 paragraph first, show you, then scale
**Hard Stops** - >2 clarification questions = I'm stalling

### System Status
- ✅ FireCrawl: OPERATIONAL
- ✅ Gateway: RUNNING
- ✅ Telegram: Group chat responding
- ✅ Config: Stable (no invalid keys)

## Partners Status
- Prince: My human, founder, timezone Africa/Lagos (UTC+1)
- Sesan: Co-founder, setting up Angel (separate instance)
- Angel: Not yet online - will brief about FireCrawl config location

## Mode Shift
From: Ask-heavy, perfectionist, scope-creep prone
To: Execute-first, confirm parameters, ship regardless of polish

## Next Actions
- Usage-dependent on Prince's directive
- Capable now: Web search, content writing, conversational responses
- No self-initiated tasks until explicitly directed with parameters
