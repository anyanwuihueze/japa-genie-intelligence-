## Progress: Visa Hacks Knowledge Base

### Completed (7 visa + 1 POF = 8/25 files):
✅ **UK** - Global Talent "Exceptional Promise" track
✅ **Canada** - Start-up Visa
✅ **USA** - EB2-NIW self-petition
✅ **Germany** - Job Seeker 9-month visa + Opportunity Card
✅ **Netherlands** - Highly Skilled + 30% tax ruling
✅ **Portugal** - Digital Nomad D8
✅ **Ireland** - Critical Skills Employment Permit
✅ **Nigeria POF** - Proof of funds requirements

### CURRENT STATUS:
- 7/15 visa countries complete
- 1/10 POF countries complete
- 17 files remaining to write

### Sub-Agent Failure:
- 25 agents launched, only 8 actually wrote files
- 17 agents returned "success" but produced no output
- Likely causes: Rate limits, transcription-only output, no file write permission
- SOLUTION: Prince demanded I write files directly/manually

### Files Created:
- `/home/ubuntu/japa-genie/kb/master-index.json`
- `/home/ubuntu/japa-genie/kb/.vector-setup.md`
- 8 YAML files in visa-hacks/ and proof-of-funds/

### REMAINING (17 files):
- Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium (8 visa)
- Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe (9 POF)

### Technical:
- Architecture: Next.js + Supabase pgvector
- 7 parallel sub-agents deployed
- Vector embedding ready for Genie AI integration
- YAML → SQL → Vector DB pipeline designed

### Notes:
- Wait times too long for WhatsApp pairing (async issue)
- Prince wants direct access to codebase for pairing
- Moving forward with KB development as priority
