## WhatsApp Integration Progress

### ✅ COMPLETED: WhatsApp Phone-based Pairing
- Successfully created `/home/ubuntu/openclaw/scripts/whatsapp-phone-pair.mjs`
- Uses Baileys' `requestPairingCode` method directly
- Credentials saved to `~/.openclaw/web-auth/default/`
- Phone number: +2349031622709
- Status: Authenticated and linked

### ⚠️ IN PROGRESS: Message Bridge Issues
- User built custom WhatsApp bridge: `/home/ubuntu/openclaw/scripts/whatsapp-bridge.mjs`
- Baileys connection opens successfully
- **Blocked:** messages.upsert not firing
- **Root cause:** Baileys v7.0.0-rc.9 breaking changes:
  - `logger?.trace is not a function` errors
  - LID session creation failures
  - Pre-key upload retries

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- Baileys v7.0.0-rc.9 has compatibility issues with message sync
- Bridge WebSocket connects to OpenClaw Gateway successfully
- Need to add proper logger instance to makeWASocket config
- Alternative: Use OpenClaw's native WhatsApp plugin with saved credentials

### 💡 Next Steps Options
1. Fix bridge with proper logger (Pino-based)
2. Enable OpenClaw native WhatsApp integration (recommended)
3. Consider downgrading Baileys if issues persist

### 📁 Key Files
- Phone pairing script: `/home/ubuntu/openclaw/scripts/whatsapp-phone-pair.mjs`
- Bridge script: `/home/ubuntu/openclaw/scripts/whatsapp-bridge.mjs`
- WhatsApp credentials: `~/.openclaw/web-auth/default/creds.json`

**Prince's preference:** User built bridge themselves, prefers solution that works with their implementation. Need to be careful not to overwrite their work without explicit permission.
