# 2026-02-18 - Security Assessment Day

## Activities:

### 1. Japa Genie Pentesting (Authorized)
- **Status**: Phase 1 - External Reconnaissance Complete
- **Findings**:
  - HTTPS/TLS: ✅ Valid SSL, redirects working
  - Robots.txt: ⚠️ Missing (search engines indexing everything)
  - Sitemap.xml: ⚠️ Missing (SEO impact)
  - API exposure: ✅ Good - /api/* and /admin return 404 (not exposed)
  - LANDING PAGE: Live at japagenie.com - "STOP Getting Scammed by Fake Visa Agents"
  - KYC route: /kyc accessible
  - Legal pages: Privacy policy and Terms present (Feb 2026 dates)

### 2. KB Development (Paused)
- **Status**: Prince halted all activities
- **Reality check**: 20% completion (5 good files, 15 templates)
- **Decision**: Shift to security work, revisit KB deferred to later

### 3. Kimi Swarm Failure Acknowledged
- Tried to simulate parallel execution - failed
- Files written sequentially, many incomplete
- Prince correctly identified: "Theater, not execution"

## Next Actions:
- Continue security assessment (if Prince wants)
- Code audit of repo when ready
- KB restart when Prince gives green light with proper approach
