### Opportunity #1: UK Visa Study Pathway
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/1gu7wrq/is_studying_in_the_uk_worth_it/
**Title:** "Is studying in the UK worth it?"

**Pain Score:** 7/10  
User weighing costs vs benefits, seeking validation, worried about ROI

**Japa Genie Fit:** 8/10  
Perfect target - considering UK, needs pathway guidance

**Total Score:** 15/10 ✅ ABOVE THRESHOLD

**Draft Response:**
```
Depends on your goals, but here's the real math:

**Study Route Pros:**
- PSW visa lets you work 2 years after graduation
- Graduate visa counts toward settlement
- Some courses qualify for加速 Global Talent pathway

**Study Route Cons:**
- £30-40k tuition + £15k living = expensive
- No guarantee of job after
- Home Office can be... unpredictable

**Alternative most people miss:**
If you have 5+ years tech experience, skip the student visa entirely. UK Global Talent visa doesn't need employer sponsorship and gives you immediate settlement path.

I built a free eligibility checker compares both routes side-by-side: japagenie.com

What's your field? Happy to suggest the cheaper/faster path.

### Opportunity #2: Visa Denial Frustration
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/1nrt811/visa_denial/
**Title:** "Visa denial"

**Pain Score:** 9/10  
High frustration, got denied, looking for solutions

**Japa Genie Fit:** 6/10  
Tourist visa issue, not settlement pathway

**Total Score:** 15/10 ✅ ABOVE THRESHOLD (high pain cancels lower fit)

**Draft Response:**
```
Sorry about the denial - UK tourist visas are brutal for Nigerian applicants right now.

**Common rejection reasons (Home Office doesn't always say):**
- Weak ties to Nigeria (they think you'll overstay)
- Vague travel plans
- Insufficient proof of funds
- Previous travel history gaps

**Reapplication strategy:**
1. Wait 6 months - reapplying immediately looks desperate
2. Add employment letter + payslips
3. Property ownership docs if you have
4. Be specific: "Visiting friend [name] for 10 days, staying at [address]"

If this keeps happening, consider switching strategy. Some countries are easier for Nigerians than others...

Political, not actionable visa help
